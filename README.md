SydneyCBD
=========

A collection of repositories of obj models of sydney CBD. One sub repository per building, that way it is easy to track versions and make pull requests. Discussions about how to structure this are welcome, as are pull requests for updated versions of buildings.

OBJ is the prefered way of storing these models. This is for a number of reasons (interoperability etc.) but mainly that github has OBJ viewing and diffs directly in the client.

There will be full details on how to contribute to this project here soon, but for now, try the [codeschool try git course](http://try.github.io/ "learn how to interact with github") for free.
