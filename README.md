SydneyCBD
=========

A collection of repositories of obj models of sydney CBD. One sub repository per building, that way it is easy to track versions and make pull requests. Discussions about how to structure this are welcome, as are pull requests for updated versions of buildings.

There will be full details on how to contribute to this project here soon, but for now, try the [codeschool try git course](http://try.github.io/ "learn how to interact with github") for free.
